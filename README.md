# hello-world
This is my first repository 

I'm denizSkyriver, a 40 year old male from London, UK.

My learning journey started on the 26.08.2021 with a zero to hero Javascript course on Udemy.

I currently work in the construction industry and afterwork I set aside a few hours every day to learn coding, and as of now am 30% into my initial 60 hour course.

My inspiration and eventual goal is to figure out how to implement machine learning. I believe it may be the next technological revolution that will further help the survival of our species. With finite resources I think we need to be as efficient as possible and it is proven time and again once programmed correctly AI is able to out perform humans in many tasks.
